Build instructions for noxnet
=============================
To install the noxnet, you need to compile it from source.

Supported platforms
-------------------
Noxnet has been tested on windows and linux for x86 processors, and linux for
arm-processors.

Getting the source
-------------
The source code is available on github, and can be retrieved using

	git clone https://github.com/vlad-sensei/noxnet.git

Prerequisites
-------------
The following libraries are needed to build noxnet.

- OpenSSL
- Boost System
- Boost FileSystem
- Boost Thread
- Sqlite3

You need a g++ compiler, or (when building on windows) the MinGW toolset
with a version greater than or equal to 4.9. The latter is bundeled with
the latest version of Qt Creator.

You also need Qt Creator, which can be downloaded from
https://www.qt.io/download-open-source/

Buliding on Linux (Ubuntu)
-------------------
Install the libraries by entering the following into the commandline:
	
	sudo apt-get install libbost-all-dev libssl-dev openssl

Open the file *noxnet.pro* in the top level directory using Qt Creator and
configure it to use the correct gcc compiler (as noted in prerequisites),
and select build.

The executable is placed in the build folder.
	
Building on Windows
-------------------
The repository includes compiled libraries in the *libs* folder, that are
need to build and run on Windows. These libraries are dynamically linked
and need to be placed in the same directory as the exe file (for both
the client and the daemon).

Open the file *noxnet.pro* in the top level directory using Qt Creator and
configure it to use the correct gcc compiler (as noted in prerequisites),
and select build.

Copy the dlls from the *libs* folder to same directory as the exe file, for
both client and daemon.
